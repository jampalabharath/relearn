# Views

This script demonstrates various **view use cases** in SQL Server.  
It includes examples for creating, dropping, and modifying views, hiding query complexity, and implementing data security by controlling data access.

## CREATE, DROP, MODIFY VIEW

### Task: Create a Monthly Sales Summary View
Aggregate by `OrderMonth` with total sales, total orders, and total quantities.

```sql
-- Create View
CREATE VIEW Sales.V_Monthly_Summary AS
(
    SELECT 
        DATETRUNC(month, OrderDate) AS OrderMonth,
        SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales,
        COUNT(OrderID) AS TotalOrders,
        SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantities
    FROM Sales.Orders
    GROUP BY DATETRUNC(month, OrderDate)
);
GO

-- Query the View
SELECT * FROM Sales.V_Monthly_Summary;

-- Drop View if it exists
IF OBJECT_ID('Sales.V_Monthly_Summary', 'V') IS NOT NULL
    DROP VIEW Sales.V_Monthly_Summary;
GO

-- Re-create the View with modified logic
CREATE VIEW Sales.V_Monthly_Summary AS
SELECT 
    DATETRUNC(month, OrderDate) AS OrderMonth,
    SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales,
    COUNT(OrderID) AS TotalOrders
FROM Sales.Orders
GROUP BY DATETRUNC(month, OrderDate);
GO
```

## VIEW USE CASE | HIDE COMPLEXITY
### Task: Abstract Multi-Table Joins with a View

Join Orders, Products, Customers, and Employees into a single view.

```sql
CREATE VIEW Sales.V_Order_Details AS
(
    SELECT 
        o.OrderID,
        o.OrderDate,
        p.Product,
        p.Category,
        COALESCE(c.FirstName, '') + ' ' + COALESCE(c.LastName, '') AS CustomerName,
        c.Country AS CustomerCountry,
        COALESCE(e.FirstName, '') + ' ' + COALESCE(e.LastName, '') AS SalesName,
        e.Department,
        o.Sales,
        o.Quantity
    FROM Sales.Orders AS o
    LEFT JOIN Sales.Products AS p ON p.ProductID = o.ProductID
    LEFT JOIN Sales.Customers AS c ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
    LEFT JOIN Sales.Employees AS e ON e.EmployeeID = o.SalesPersonID
);
GO
```

## VIEW USE CASE | DATA SECURITY
### Task: Restrict Access for EU Sales Team

Exclude USA data from order details.

```sql
CREATE VIEW Sales.V_Order_Details_EU AS
(
    SELECT 
        o.OrderID,
        o.OrderDate,
        p.Product,
        p.Category,
        COALESCE(c.FirstName, '') + ' ' + COALESCE(c.LastName, '') AS CustomerName,
        c.Country AS CustomerCountry,
        COALESCE(e.FirstName, '') + ' ' + COALESCE(e.LastName, '') AS SalesName,
        e.Department,
        o.Sales,
        o.Quantity
    FROM Sales.Orders AS o
    LEFT JOIN Sales.Products AS p ON p.ProductID = o.ProductID
    LEFT JOIN Sales.Customers AS c ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
    LEFT JOIN Sales.Employees AS e ON e.EmployeeID = o.SalesPersonID
    WHERE c.Country != 'USA'
);
GO
```
